# TicTacMaster
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging two-player game where each player takes turns marking either "X" or "O" in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to connect three of your symbols in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—before your opponent does. Perfect for quick, competitive rounds with friends!
