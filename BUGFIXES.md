## 🛠️ **REMAINING ISSUES (Not in whats-new.tsx)**

The following TypeScript errors exist in other files but are separate from the original whats-new.tsx issues:

### 1. Game State Management Issues
- **Files**: `hooks/use-game-state.tsx`, `hooks/use-socket.tsx`
- **Issues**: Socket.io type definitions and game state type mismatches
- **Impact**: Medium - affects online multiplayer functionality

### 2. Sidebar Component Issues  
- **File**: `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
- **Issues**: Circular import definitions and ref type mismatches
- **Impact**: Low - sidebar still functions but has type warnings

### 3. Settings Property Issues
- **Files**: `components/avatar-selector.tsx`, `components/chat-box.tsx`
- **Issues**: Property name mismatches in settings objects
- **Impact**: Low - easily fixed by updating property names
